### If we execute this Javascript, what will the browser's console show?

```javascript
var text = 'outside';
function logIt(){
    console.log(text);
    var text = 'inside';
};
logIt();

### In order to win the prize for most cookies sold, my friend Alice and I are going to merge our Girl Scout Cookies orders and enter as one unit.
Each order is represented by an "order id" (an integer).

We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in arrays. Write a function to merge our arrays of orders into one sorted array.

For example:
```javascript
var myArray     = [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 15];
var alicesArray = [1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 19];

console.log(mergeArrays(myArray, alicesArray));
// logs [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]
```

### We're building a web game where everybody wins and we are all friends forever.
It's simpleâ€”you click on one of three boxes to see what nice thing you've won. You always win something nice. Because we love you.

Here's what we have so far. Something's going wrong though. Can you tell what it is?

```html
<button id="btn-0">Button 1!</button>
<button id="btn-1">Button 2!</button>
<button id="btn-2">Button 3!</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
    var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Fresh Laundry!'];
    for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
        // for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
        document.getElementById('btn-' + btnNum).onclick = function() {
            // tell her what she's won!
            alert(prizes[btnNum]);
        };
    }
</script>
```
